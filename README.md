# Hi, I'm Olaf 👋

I'm a Incident Responder & Threat Hunter at Deloitte, podcast speaker and creative designer enthousiast. I'm one of the founders of [Realised](https://realised.nl), where we try to help universities in order to achieve their sustainable goals. Next to that I like to take some pictures or fly my drone from time to time.
